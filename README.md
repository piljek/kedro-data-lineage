# kedro-data-lineage
**[Documentation](https://piljek.github.io/kedro-data-lineage/)**
This GitHub repository provides a comprehensive demonstration of a data lineage implementation using Kedro, an open-source Python library, and various source systems. This repository showcases the setup and utilization of pipelines described in the Medium Blog Post to demonstrate enablement of data lineage.

**Data lineage** refers to the process of documenting and tracking the journey of data from its origin to its final destinations, encompassing the various systems and transformations it undergoes along the way.

Through interactive exploration and visualization, the repository illustrates the modeling of projections across source systems, calculation of key performance indicators (KPIs), and derivation of sales statistics. The code and examples provided offer valuable insights into establishing data lineage, ensuring data quality, and facilitating impact analysis in enterprise data pipelines.
